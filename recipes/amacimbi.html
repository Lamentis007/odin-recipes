    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>Amacimbi (Mopane Worms)</h4>
    <p>Amacimbi are edible caterpillars that are typically dried, then fried or stewed in tomato-onion sauce. They're
        crunchy, savory, and rich in protein — often enjoyed with sadza.</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups dried mopane worms (amacimbi)</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 medium tomatoes, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Cooking oil (vegetable or sunflower)</li>
        <li>1 cup hot water (for rehydrating)</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried mopane worms in hot water for about 10–15 minutes to rehydrate.</li>
        <li>Rinse thoroughly and drain to remove sand or debris.</li>
        <li>In a pan, heat oil and sauté the onions until soft and golden.</li>
        <li>Add garlic (if using) and tomatoes, and cook until tomatoes break down into a thick sauce.</li>
        <li>Add the rehydrated mopane worms and stir to coat with the sauce.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and simmer for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with sadza.</li>
    </ol>
